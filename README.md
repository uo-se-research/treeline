# TreeLine

<img align="left" src="treeline-logo.png" width=100>
Finding slow input faster using Monte-Carlo Tree Search and application provided context-free grammar. 

This is a testing version of the code TreeLine (the exact code used for experimentation). We are aware that it is not
user-friendly. However, we wanted to share the code to comply the open-source policy. The repository will change
drastically after paper submission. We will refactor most of the code and add all the necessary documentation.

## Usage:

- Build the Docker image:
```sh
docker build -t treeline:latest .
```

- Run a new container
```sh
docker run -p 2300:2300 --name fse -it treeline /bin/bash
```
- From the container run the AFL listener for one of the target applications using the commands provided in their 
documentation ([wf](target_apps/word-frequency/README.md), [libxml](target_apps/libxml2/README.md), 
[graphviz](target_apps/graphviz/README.md), [flex](target_apps/flex/README.md)).
e.g. , 
```shell
afl-treeline -i /home/treeline/target_apps/graphviz/inputs/ -o /home/results/graphviz-001 -p -N 500 -d dot
```

Run [mcts_expr](mcts_exper.py) with the configuration you want form your local machine or the `fse` container itself. 
```shell
python3.9 mcts_exper.py
```

## Navigational Helper:
- The [src](src) directory is where all source code is stored.
  - The [gramm](src/gramm) directory is a package to read grammar files and return them as objects we can work with.
  - The [mcts](src/mcts) directory is a package where all the main MCTS algorithm lives.
  - The file [epsilonStrategy](src/epsilonStrategy.py), [targetAppConnect](src/targetAppConnect.py), 
  and [utilities](src/utilities.py) are helper files for non-core functions.
  - The file [mcts_exper](src/mcts_exper.py) is the file used to run an experiment.
- The [resources](resources) directory is dir where we keep some resources needed during building the docker container.  
- The [target_apps](target_apps) directory is where all the benchmarks we used, grammars, seed inputs are stored.
