:Usage example:
.. code-block:: python

    for i in [0, 499, 500, 999, 1000, 99999, 100000, 999999, 1000000, 999999999, 1000000000]:
        idx = np.digitize(i, bins=buckets)
        print(f"range: {i} has index={idx} which translate to tail={tails[idx]}")

:The results would be:
.. code-block::

    range: 0 has index=0 which translate to tail=200000
    range: 499 has index=0 which translate to tail=200000
    range: 500 has index=1 which translate to tail=100000
    range: 999 has index=1 which translate to tail=100000
    range: 1000 has index=2 which translate to tail=50000
    range: 99999 has index=2 which translate to tail=50000
    range: 100000 has index=3 which translate to tail=25000
    range: 999999 has index=3 which translate to tail=25000
    range: 1000000 has index=4 which translate to tail=10000
    range: 999999999 has index=4 which translate to tail=10000
    range: 1000000000 has index=5 which translate to tail=5000
