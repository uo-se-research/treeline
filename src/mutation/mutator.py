"""Mutation of derivation trees styled after Nautilus (roughly).
Two kinds of mutation at a non-terminal symbol in the derivation tree:
   (a)  Generate a random substitute subtree
   (b)  Splice a previously seen tree

December 2022:  Refactoring to separate identification of potential mutations or hybrids
  from selecting one, so that selection and adjustment of weights ("learning") can be
  put in one place where we can measure and calibrate.
